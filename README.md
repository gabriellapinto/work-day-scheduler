# work-day-scheduler

## About This Project:
The objective for this project was to use the starter code and build an interactive work day scheduler using Day.js and jQuery. I had to identify the current time of the day and use that to tell the application if it is the past, present, or future for the time-blocks. As well as this, I displayed the current date at the top of the page. I also used localStorage to save the users input in the correct time blocks to they can come back to the application and check on their tasks.
